# Data-Visualisation
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data using Python in Google Colab. We used libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore total sales, number of orders, average sales per order, category-wise performance, and regional sales trends. The final deliverable includes a visual report with screenshots and a summary of key business insights.
